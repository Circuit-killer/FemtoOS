\subsection{Detailed Description}
Since at that time a task is running there is no need for the O\-S stack, we make a union of the background variables and the O\-S stack. Note that this places boundaries of the Stack\-Size (which can be checked), and implies that the structure of \hyperlink{struct_ttask_save}{Ttask\-Save} depends on the direction of stack growth and the alignment of the array and the structure (which is assumed to be top-\/aligned, i.\-e. the lowest used addresses match). Thus this is a delicate matter. Therefore we have the possibility to use a normal struct as well. Note the Stack\-O\-S must be the first field, because of the definition of \-\_\-\-\_\-do\-\_\-stack\-\_\-def\-: in the devices files. (i don't know a way to address x\-O\-S.\-Stack\-O\-S in assembly directly). 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
